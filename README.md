# parsec-space
It is a web app that has an AJAX enabled search of 3500+ exoplanets and a user login portal that has features like online quiz etc. 
and admin portal with some admin capabilities.
To run the project locally on your computer one need to have XAMPP-to create a server and to create database link.
Then import the sql file "space.sql" by going to "localhost/phpmyadmin" and the click on import tab.
Then one must copy all these file inside the "htdocs" folder which you will find within xampp folder.I prefer you to copy all the repositry 
files inside a new folder "parsec".
After this just go to your web browser and type "localhost/parsec/cot.html" but before that make sure to open the localserver and mysql 
database connection.
